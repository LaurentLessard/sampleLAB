# sampleLAB
 ## File name: sampleLab.m
    Function : sampleLAB(delta)- Generates a grid of points uniformly spaced in LAB space 
    which can be mapped to RGB space.
    Input : delta - scalar - distance between two adjacent points on a grid on the same axis)
            rot   - scalar - rotation angle of the grid
    Output : Nx3 matrix of coordinates in Lab, RGB, xyY space where N = #colors existing in RGB
